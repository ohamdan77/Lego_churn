# Lego_churn

This repository is for the Lego Churn Prediction Hackathon.
In this Hackathon we will be doing the following:

  * import the data and exploring the data to work with

  * apply some feature engineering on the data

  * create a Feature store table and write the engineered features to it

  * Create an autoML experiment and explore the result of it

  * Register the best model to MLFlow registery

  * Use the registered model for inference

More instructions about every step will be located in the notebooks.
Good Luck
